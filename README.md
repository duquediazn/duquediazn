# Hey there!

I’m a full stack web developer who cares about building software that respects its users, not by harvesting data or hijacking attention, but by being honest, functional, and clear.

That’s why I’m committed to learning, collaboration, and keeping tech human through ethical, open approaches. It’s not always easy, but I believe it’s worth doing right.

**Tabulae** is an inventory management platform built to make stock control transparent and visual. Real-time updates, expiration alerts, and interactive dashboards with dynamic charts that turn raw data into clear insights, revealing trends across products and warehouses.

This is an **active portfolio project**, built not only to showcase full-stack capabilities, but to evolve through continuous learning, real-world problem solving, and clean architectural design.
